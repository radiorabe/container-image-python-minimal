Replace <code>:latest</code> with a specific version in the examples below.</p> <pre><code>FROM ghcr.io/radiorabe/python-minimal:latest AS build\n\nCOPY ./ /app/\n\nRUN    cd /app \\\n    &amp;&amp; python3 -mpip --no-cache-dir install wheel \\\n    &amp;&amp; python3 setup.py bdist_wheel\n\n\nFROM ghcr.io/radiorabe/python-minimal:latest AS app\n\nCOPY --from=build /app/dist/*.whl /tmp/dist/\n\nRUN    python3 -mpip --no-cache-dir install /tmp/dist/*.whl \\\n    &amp;&amp; rm -rf /tmp/dist/\n\nUSER nobody\n\nCMD [\"python3\", \"-mapp\"]\n</code></pre> <p>The argument to <code>CMD</code> needs to call a Python module containing a <code>__main__</code> cli entrypoint. It is recommended that this is packaged as a <code>console_scripts</code> style command line script.</p> <p>You can install os packages using microdnf. ie. if you use setuptools-git-versioning you would install <code>git-core</code> to make it work.</p> <pre><code>FROM ghcr.io/radiorabe/python-minimal:latest AS build\n\nCOPY ./ /app/\n\nRUN    cd /app \\\n    &amp;&amp; microdnf install git-core \\\n    &amp;&amp; python3 -mpip --no-cache-dir install setuptools-git-versioning wheel \\\n    &amp;&amp; python3 setup.py bdist_wheel\n\n\nFROM ghcr.io/radiorabe/python-minimal:latest AS app\n\n# ... same as in first example\n</code></pre> <p>In some cases it can make sense to install some Python requirements as os dependencies.

You can validate this by checking the output of the container image build which should not contain a <code>Downloading psycopg2*.whl</code> line in the <code>app</code> containers <code>python3 -mpip install</code> phase. </p>"},{"location":"#release-management","title":"Release Management","text":"<p>The CI/CD setup uses semantic commit messages following the conventional commits standard.
